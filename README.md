oldFBXloader.html shows the correct functionality which we need. This scene uses the FBXLoader from the Three.js release 88

In the file newFBXloader.html the same FBX-file behaves very differently. The positions of the object are wrong and the animations are messed up. This happens with the FBXLoaders which are from the  Three.js release 89 and later.
